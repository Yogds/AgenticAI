# AgenticAI POC

This repository contains a Proof of Concept (POC) for exploring agentic AI systems. The goal is to experiment with autonomous agents that can perceive, reason, and act within a defined environment.

## Overview

Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that operate as agentsâ€”entities capable of making decisions, taking actions, and pursuing goals autonomously. This POC demonstrates basic agentic behaviors, such as:

- Perception: Gathering information from the environment
- Reasoning: Making decisions based on goals and observations
- Action: Executing tasks to achieve objectives

## Features

- Modular agent architecture
- Simple environment simulation
- Configurable agent goals and behaviors
- Logging and monitoring of agent actions

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AgenticAI.git
   cd AgenticAI
